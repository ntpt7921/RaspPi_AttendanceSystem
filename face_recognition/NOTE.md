# Preamble

There will not be much here beside references, since I don't have enough time to learn a lot about face detection.

# References

- [1]: [Real-Time Face Recognition: An End-To-End Project](https://towardsdatascience.com/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-b738bb0f7348)
  A very good starting point, go through to process step-by-step, though do refer to the newer documentation of OpenCV since some of the code here is quite old.
- [2]: [Face detection using OpenCV and Python: A beginner's guide](https://www.superdatascience.com/blogs/opencv-face-detection/)
  Go through and explain face detection using OpenCV, very easy to understand. I find the writer humorous.
- [3]: [Face recognition using OpenCV and Python: A beginner's guide](https://www.superdatascience.com/blogs/opencv-face-recognition)
  Same writer as [2], explaning face recognition.
- [4]: [Face Detection â€“ OpenCV, Dlib and Deep Learning ( C++ / Python )](https://learnopencv.com/face-detection-opencv-dlib-and-deep-learning-c-python/)
  List various library and methods for implementing face detection, have comparison for each method (speed, accuracy).
- [5]: [Face Detection Models: Which to Use and Why?](https://towardsdatascience.com/face-detection-models-which-to-use-and-why-d263e82c302c)
  Like [4].
- [6]: [Face detection with OpenCV and deep learning](https://pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/26/face-detection-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/)
  Tutorial for using OpenCV DNN face detection model.
- [7]: [Face Recognition: Understanding LBPH Algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/face-recognition-how-lbph-works-90ec258c3d6b)
  Explain the LBPH face recognition
- [8]: [OpenCV Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/)
  Must mention this. Choose the version that you have. I have locally version 4.5.1. Should not have much different between major version (4.x.x).
- [9]: [Face Recognition with OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/da/d60/tutorial_face_main.html)
  Tutorial for the face module in OpenCV. Scary math. Example in C++ but the logic is the same. I skimmed through this. Read all the article if you dare.
